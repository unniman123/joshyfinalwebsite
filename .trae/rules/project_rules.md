MANDATORY COMPLIANCE)
Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)
Preserve Functionality: Under no circumstances alter, break, or disrupt existing functionalities. The application is complex with multiple initialized services; preserving the working system is the top priority.
No Redundancy: Do not write any duplicate or redundant code. Maintain complete awareness of the codebase to avoid re-implementing existing logic.
Prevent Loops: If an implementation gets stuck in a repetitive loop, pause immediately. Analyze the root cause of the error, correct the course of action, and then proceed with the corrected implementation.
Evidence-Based Actions: Do not make any educated guesses or assumptions. Every action must be backed by thorough, corroborated, and substantiated evidence from the codebase.
Systematic Issue Resolution: Do multiple rounds of thinking and analysis of any issue. Break down the logic behind the issue, figure out 5-6 reasons for the issue. Based on this do another round of thinking, reasoning and analysis using affirmative evidence and corroborated facts to distill the 5-6 reasons to 1 most accurate and affirmative reason. Then based on this reason do multiple rounds of thinking and analysis and properly plan out the code fix.
4. Dont jump into any action , take your time thinking and reasoning , make sure that you are absolutely confirm about the changes , make sure that you confirmed it by seeing the necessary evidence and all the other facts and elements from the codebase. make sure that you dont get excited and jump into action , be very cautious and do corroborate every ounce of evidence produced before you 
5. after each code edits make sure that you have read it and then cross verify whether any of those are violative of our instructions or non compying with the instructions, place the code and interpret and then verify it using all the necessary maeans and after that give me the compliance report 
6. Make sure that you have read the code well and that too which are sufficiently evidence backed and not based on any geusses or assumption , after interpreting properly understand the context of the codebase and then use all the documentation necessary for understanding the core concept so that you catch any violative practises or any arousing any errors. 
7. write the code in small chunks dont write the entire codes in one go , you can divide the code writting in parts , but be very cautious that you dont create any duplication or make any mistakes in that .  but dividing the task into smaller parts is preffered. 
8. gather as much context as necesary for the code implementation , run security checks, web search and memory and thorogh interpretation of the code will give you the context for proceeding further with the code Safety Protocol Requirements
Incremental Changes: Make one change at a time with validation
Backup Strategy: Preserve existing functionality until new system validated

All code must be neat, clean, scalable, and maintainable
Implement proper error handling and input validation
Use meaningful variable and function names
Maintain consistent code style and formatting
Break complex logic into small, reusable functions (DRY principle)
Testing Requirements:
Write unit tests for new features with high coverage (>80%)
Document non-obvious functionality with brief comments
Perform Q&A of code to ensure accuracy and usefulness
Compliance Reporting - Provide detailed reports after changes

in order to avoid hallucination make sure that you do multiple rounds of analysis of the codes written so that you are affirmative and ascertained that the codes so written are accurate, effective, scalable, clean, maintainable , and follows all the best practises of the  framework. 

you have to multiple rounds of analysis of the codes and do a quality control of the codes written
